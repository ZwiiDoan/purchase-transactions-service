# Purchase Transactions Service

### Requirements

1. The Application can store a purchase transaction with a description, transaction date, and a purchase amount in
   United States dollars. When the transaction is stored, it will be assigned a unique
   identifier. Field requirements:
    * Description: must not exceed 50 characters
    * Transaction date: must be a valid date
    * Purchase amount: must be a valid amount rounded to the nearest cent
    * Unique identifier: must uniquely identify the purchase
2. The Application can retrieve the stored purchase transactions converted to currencies supported by the [Treasury
   Reporting Rates of Exchange API](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/treasury-reporting-rates-exchange/treasury-reporting-rates-of-exchange)
   based upon the exchange rate active for the date of the purchase. The retrieved purchase should include:
    * The identifier
    * The description
    * The transaction date
    * The original US dollar purchase amount
    * The exchange rate used
    * The converted amount based upon the specified currencyâ€™s exchange rate for the date of the purchase.

   Currency conversion requirements:
    * Must use a currency conversion rate less than or equal to the purchase date from within the last 6 months.
    * If no currency conversion rate is available within 6 months equal to or before the purchase date, an error should
      be returned stating the purchase cannot be converted to the target currency.
    * The converted purchase amount to the target currency should be rounded to two decimal places (i.e., cent).
3. The application repository should be runnable without installing additional software stack components, such as
   databases, web servers, or servlet containers (e.g., Jetty, Tomcat, etc).

### Assumptions

1. Dates in Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange API are in UTC timezone
2. Purchase Transaction dates are also in UTC timezone.
3. Requirement #3 prevents Docker Engine Installation and Usage but not Java 17 Installation and Embedded/In-memory
   database (H2) which requires no extra installation.

### Solution

The Application is built as a Web Service that exposes 2 endpoints to store and retrieve a single Purchase Transaction.
For more information about the endpoints, please open [pts-swagger.yml](pts-swagger.yml).

The 1st endpoint "Store a Purchase Transaction" is straight-forward: an incoming Purchase Transactions is validated and
assigned a UUID as `Transaction Id` before getting persisted into a Database. A Valid Purchase Transactions must
satisfy:

* Description is optional and cannot exceed 50 characters
* Transaction date is required and must not be in future
* Purchase amount is required and must be greater than 0

The diagram below depicts solution for the 2nd endpoint "Retrieve a stored purchase transaction":

* The endpoint requires a `Transaction Id` and `Currency` (`country_currency_desc` supported
  by [Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange API](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/treasury-reporting-rates-exchange/treasury-reporting-rates-of-exchange))
* The application will store the exchange rate fetched from the API into Database so that it
  will not need to make the downstream call for every user request.
* When sending requests to Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange API, the application always asks for the
  latest exchange rate that is not older than 6 months from the purchase date to satisfy Requirement #2. This is
  achieved by using the API query
  params: `&filter=country_currency_desc:eq:{Requested-Country-Currency},effective_date:gte:{Purchase-Date-6-Months-Ago},effective_date:lte:{Purchase-Date}&sort=-record_date&page[number]=1&page[size]=1`.
  This approach minimises the implementation required and the amount of data needs to be transferred.
* The application utilises [Resilience4j](https://resilience4j.readme.io/docs/getting-started-3) to implement best
  practice patterns when interacting with downstream services such as: circuit-breaker, rate-limiting (throttling),
  bulkhead and retry.

### Build

Execute from repo's root directory

```
/.gradlew clean build
```

The build pipeline integrates different tools to verify code quality and security such as:

* [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) to ensure coding standard using Google Checkstyle
  at [config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml](config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml)
* [Spotbugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) with plugin [FindSecBugs](https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/) that do static
  analysis to look for common bugs and security bugs in Java code
* [Jacoco](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco) to ensure code and test coverage. The minimum instruction
  and branch coverage of this repo is 95% which is satisfied by unit tests and integration tests.
* [OWASP dependency-check-gradle plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.owasp.dependencycheck) to scan for CVEs
  in the project dependencies. This task is not a part of default build task as it takes a lot of time. However, it can
  be executed separately by command `./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze`.
* For local test and CI pipeline, the repo uses Embedded/In-memory database (H2)
  and [Wiremock](https://wiremock.org/docs/junit-jupiter/) to stimulate the [Treasury
  Reporting Rates of Exchange API](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/treasury-reporting-rates-exchange/treasury-reporting-rates-of-exchange).
  In remote and production environments, these dependencies are expected to be production-grade systems such as AWS RDS
  and the actual API. The application is also expected to be deployed as multiple Docker containers/computing instances
  in a High Availability and Secured Infrastructure with production-grade systems such as AWS ECS/EKS exposing endpoints
  via an API Gateway.
* The application uses [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) to manage [DB migrations](src/main/resources/db/migration).
  Flyway is enabled at application start-up in local Development and Test environments but will be executed in a
  separated CD Pipeline in remote environments.

### Demo

Execute from repo's root directory

```
/.gradlew bootRun
```

* In Demo environment ("default" profile) the application integrates with embedded/in-memory
  H2 Database and connects to the
  real [Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange API](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/treasury-reporting-rates-exchange/treasury-reporting-rates-of-exchange)

* User can store a Purchase Transaction with this curl command

```
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/v1/purchase-transaction' \
--header 'Correlation-Id: 08ef44c8-5477-44d1-a61c-f0931abf37bf' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "description": "test-description",
    "transactionDate": "2023-09-01",
    "purchaseAmount": 9999.0312789000
}'
```

Then retrieve the transaction using id in previous response and curl command

```
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/v1/purchase-transaction/{transaction-id}?currency=Australia-Dollar' \
--header 'Correlation-Id: 08ef44c8-5477-44d1-a61c-f0931abf37bf'
```

### Future Improvements & Considerations

1. Error response schema can be adjusted to include more fields and show/hide details if required by enterprise
   standards or business requirements.
2. More Observability tools can be integrated to provide distributed tracing, logging, metrics
   with [Spring Boot 3 Observability](https://spring.io/blog/2022/10/12/observability-with-spring-boot-3) such as
   [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana]https://grafana.com/, [Loki](https://github.com/loki4j/loki-logback-appender),
   etc.
3. NoSQL Database can be used instead of Relational Database for better scaling since the data model is relatively
   simple and there is no requirement for complex queries.
